    # High-Dimensional Problems ($p \gg N$) — ESL Ch. 18

    *Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman (2009). The Elements of Statistical Learning. §18.1-18.4.*

    When the number of features $p$ exceeds the sample size $N$, classical least squares
    is **not identifiable** (singular $X^\top X$).  **Regularisation** — ridge, lasso,
    elastic net — is required to obtain stable estimators and to encode sparsity or
    shrinkage priors.

    ## Curse of dimensionality (§18.1)

    In high dimensions, data are sparse: local neighbourhoods are empty unless $N$ grows
    exponentially with dimension.  Global methods that pool information (regularised
    linear models, ensembles) are often more reliable than naive nearest-neighbour
    regression in the $p \gg N$ regime.

    ## Lasso vs ridge (§18.2-18.3)

    **Ridge** shrinks all coefficients but sets none to exactly zero.  **Lasso** performs
    **subset selection** via the $\ell_1$ penalty; in the linear Gaussian model with $p > N$,
    at most $N$ predictors can have nonzero coefficients at any penalty level (genericity).

    ## Elastic net (§18.4)

    The elastic net mixes $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, stabilising variable selection when
    predictors are correlated — a compromise between ridge and lasso.  The simulation and
    TMDB sections below are chosen so you can *see* sparsity, multiple testing, and
    high-$p$ noise in plots — not to tune a single best score.

    ## Geometry: the curse of dimensionality (§18.1)

    In a $d$-dimensional unit box $[0,1]^d$, a slightly smaller concentric box of side
    $1-\varepsilon$ captures **fraction** $(1-\varepsilon)^d$ of the volume, which
    decays to $0$ as $d$ increases.  That is one face of the **empty neighbourhood**
    phenomenon: with fixed sample size, local information becomes scarce unless
    the effective dimension is controlled (regularisation, feature selection, or manifold
